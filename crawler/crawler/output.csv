She just won't say it. Unlike Dotard and many like him in Washington and the western bureaucracy. They are all looking after their own special interests."

Now that they cannot dictate all the matters of the world, many resort to unreasonable obstruction to free trade.
This is surely the fastest road to decline and decay.
Ignorant western politicians ( most of whom are newly elected by a failed process of special interest support oftwn know very little about the world )do not even bother to learn about past failed attempt at protectionism and the current reality of a multi polar world. These elected politicians ( canot call them leaders simply because they do not have the ability to lead ) will lead their own countries straight over the cliff."
